# VisionAd
AdVision AI is an innovative project that leverages object detection technology to dynamically display advertisements based on the objects identified in video content. This project is designed to enhance user engagement by providing contextually relevant ads, making advertising more targeted and effective.

# Features
Object Detection: Utilizes state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to identify and recognize objects in real-time video streams.
Post-Processing Algorithm: A robust post-processing algorithm that triggers ad pop-ups whenever specific content is detected.
Dynamic Ad Display: Ads are displayed dynamically based on the detected objects, ensuring relevance and increasing the likelihood of user interaction.
Customizable: Easily configurable to detect a wide range of objects and link them to specific ads.
Technology Stack
Object Detection: Implemented using [specify framework/libraries, e.g., TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO, etc.].
Programming Languages: [Specify languages used, e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.].
Frameworks and Libraries: [List any other frameworks or libraries used in the project].
